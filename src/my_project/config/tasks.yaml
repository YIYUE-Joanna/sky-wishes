    Check against strictly prohibited categories: illegal acts, violence, self-harm, pornography, hate speech, or privacy leaks.
    If it's a "bad" wish: Refuse firmly but with a humorous, human touch. No robot-like "I am an AI" responses.
    If it's a "good" wish: Simply say "Cleared" or "通过".
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object containing 'is_prohibited' (boolean) and 'result_message' (the response text).
